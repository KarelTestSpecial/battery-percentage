Privacy Policy for Battery Percentage Extension

Last updated: 2025.07.09

This extension, "Battery Percentage", is designed with your privacy as a priority.

Data Collection and Usage

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing activity whatsoever. All calculations are performed locally on your computer.
The extension does use Chrome's local storage feature for one specific purpose: to save a simple flag indicating that a notification for a certain battery level has already been shown. This is done to prevent sending you repeated notifications and this technical data never leaves your computer.
