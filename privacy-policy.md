Privacy Policy for Battery Percentage Extension

  Last updated: 2025.07.09


  This extension, "Battery Percentage", is designed with your privacy as a priority.

  Data Collection and Usage


  This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing activity whatsoever. All calculations are performed
  locally on your computer.
  The extension uses the Chrome Idle API to check the user's idle state (active, idle, or locked) to determine when it is appropriate to
  display battery notifications. This information is processed locally and is not collected, stored, or transmitted.
  The extension does use Chrome's local storage feature for one specific purpose: to save a simple flag indicating that a notification for a
  certain battery level has already been shown. This is done to prevent sending you repeated notifications and this technical data never
  leaves your computer.
